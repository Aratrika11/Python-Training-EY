What is Python? 
Python is a high – level , general – purpose programming language created by Guido Van Rossum and first released in 1991. It was designed with readability, simplicity, and developer productivity in mind. Unlike languages that prioritize machine efficiency, Python emphasizes human-friendly code, making it especially suitable for beginners while still being powerful enough for advanced applications.

The Origins of Python
Before Python, many programming languages required developers to manage complex syntax, repetitive coding structures, and low-level operations. Guido van Rossum envisioned a language that would:
•	Reduce unnecessary complexity
•	Allow developers to express ideas with fewer lines of code.
•	Encourage clarity through clean and readable syntax.
•	Support multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python was created to bridge the gap between power and simplicity – offering the flexibility of languages like C while maintaining readability similar to plain English
